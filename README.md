# About the project
CleanAxis is a digital platform that aims to connect green energy potential with real investment across the ECO region. By using an AI-based policy assistant and map-based visualizations, the project addresses scattered data and complex regulations that often slow down renewable energy projects. It presents a shared space where investors, startups, and policymakers could work together using the same reliable information.
Although still a proof-of-concept, the project demonstrates how system design and decision logic could help transform complex regional data into practical energy planning and investment decisions.
